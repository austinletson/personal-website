> "We are thickly layered, page lying upon page, behind simple covers. And love - it is not the book itself, but the binding."
Deb Caletti

Bindings serve three purposes. Above all, the binding enforces the order of the pages and holds the text block in place for the reader. Reading copies of books with sturdy bindings can last hundreds of years. Second to structure, the boards and the spine serve as an advertisement. These elements participate in the first moments between book and reader. The spine is exposed on the shelf for the reader to judge the contents. Most books in libraries and book shops never make it past this preliminary phase of selection. Their spines are insufficiently sexy or desperately baroque. Though a beautiful spine is not enough. Next the reader must examine the front and back boards, searching for a reason to flip through the pages. Only after the binding has played its hand does the reader take to the text. The third purpose lies in the aesthetic value of a book binding. An unremarkable text in an attractive binding becomes remarkable. 

In the 15th century the combination of the printing press and cotton paper led to a standardization of binding. The rounding of edges and the use of shoulders to support the text block inspired the upright storage of books and the placement of spinal titles. Here binding picks up speed as an art form of its own.

The introduction of the modern cloth binding came in 1821 when William Pickering published a small run of so called Diamond Classics for the 4.5 point, yes 4.5 point, Diamond type. The books sported Morroco leather or cloth bindings which held Virgil in Latin. Below is a later volume containing Cicero with a penny for scale.

The modern primary market deemphasizes bindings in favor of dust jackets. When jackets first appeared in the early eighteenth century, they enclosed the book entirely, covering the text block. In most cases, they were not designed for reuse after the original unwrapping, sometimes not even reaching the eyes of the buyer. The flap style jackets which are popular today were not prevalent until the 1890s. Jackets use imagery and text to advertise the contents of the book where bindings generally sport minimalist and abstract art. 

Lets look at an interesting binding which showcases the beauty of traditional book binding. A French novel with titled *Paris Burns by the Town*. It bears a beautiful white leather spine which imitates older bindings made of animal skin. Gilt grenades and firearms tastefully establish theme alongside the popping blue and orange paint.

The boards are red and blue marble with yellow accent. The contrast between the white leather spine and the multicolored boards leaves the reader with a taste of conflict before opening the book.

I don't speak French, but I an intrigued.

Book binding has a rich history which I couldn't hope to cover here. The practical and artistic tradition of preserving and binding text dates back even before printing. This tradition give us all an opportunity to look under the jacket and judge a book by its cover.
