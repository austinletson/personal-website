**:wq** is arguably the most notorious command in the Vim editor.

The core problem underneath the meme is that Vim isn't an obviously
discoverable editor. When you open up Visual Studio Code. Although
graphical Emacs has a tool bar by default, the keyboard equivalent of
**:wq**, **<C-c><C-x>** is far less intuitive. 


**:cquit** exit vim with an error code
